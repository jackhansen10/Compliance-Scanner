# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues privately to the maintainers.

If you are able, use GitHub Security Advisories:
https://github.com/jackhansen10/Compliance-Scanner/security/advisories/new

If that does not work for you, open an issue and clearly mark it as
security-sensitive so we can move the discussion to a private channel.

## Supported versions

Security fixes are applied to the default branch. There is no formal
backporting policy at this time.

## Response expectations

We aim to acknowledge reports within 7 days and provide a remediation plan or
status update within 30 days, depending on complexity.
